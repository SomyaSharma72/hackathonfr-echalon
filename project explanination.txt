🛠️ Technologies & Languages Used (Simplified – No Deployment)
🌐 Frontend (What You See – The Website)

HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

The skeleton of web pages.

Defines structure: buttons, login form, chat list, message box.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

The style & design of the website.

Adds colors, layouts, animations, and makes it look modern.

JavaScript (JS)

The interactive part of the frontend.

Handles clicking, fetching messages from backend, showing AI suggestions.

⚙️ Backend (The Brain – Server Side)

Python

Main language running the logic of the project.

Handles user login, APIs, message management, and AI replies.

Flask (Python Web Framework)

The glue between frontend & backend.

Serves HTML files and creates APIs like /api/messages or /api/send_message.

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)

The bridge to other apps.

Lets your project talk to Telegram, Instagram, Twitter.

Telethon (Python Library)

Connects with Telegram using API keys.

Fetches chats and sends messages.

Instagrapi (Python Library)

Connects with Instagram.

Manages login, fetches DMs, and sends replies.

Requests (Python Library)

For making web requests.

Helps communicate with external APIs easily.

🤖 AI & Machine Learning

Transformers (Hugging Face Library)

Runs AI models for chat suggestions.

Used to load BlenderBot.

Torch (PyTorch)

The engine under the hood that powers the AI model.

Runs the neural network computations.

BlenderBot (AI Model)

The robot brain for generating smart reply suggestions.

💾 Database

SQLite (messages.db)

A lightweight database stored in a file.

Saves all your old chats & messages locally.

🗂️ Project Environment

Virtual Environment (env/)

A sandbox for Python dependencies.

Keeps your installed libraries organized and project-specific.

✅ So now it’s:

Frontend → HTML, CSS, JS

Backend → Python, Flask, APIs, Telethon, Instagrapi, Requests

AI → Transformers, Torch, BlenderBot

Database → SQLite

Environment → Virtual Environment





📩 Unified Inbox Project – Simple Summary
🔹 What is This?

Unified Inbox is an app that brings all your chats (Telegram, Instagram, Twitter) into one dashboard.
Instead of switching apps, you can see & reply to all messages in one place.

🔹 How Does It Work? (Super Simple)

You log in with email & password.

Sidebar shows buttons for Telegram, Instagram, Twitter.

Click one → see all your chats.

Pick a chat → messages appear.

Type a reply → send directly from dashboard.

An AI Suggestion box pops up with smart reply ideas (powered by BlenderBot 🤖).

🔹 Main Parts (Files & Folders)

app.py → The backend brain. Connects to Telegram/Instagram, saves chats in a database, handles AI replies.

dashboard.html → The chat dashboard (where you see & reply to messages).

index.html → The login/welcome page with preloader, features, etc.

config.py → Stores your secret keys (Telegram API ID & Hash).

messages.db (SQLite) → Stores all chats locally.

env/ → Python environment (all installed libraries).

templates/ → Folder with HTML files.

🔹 How Things Connect

You log in → Flask shows dashboard.

Dashboard asks backend (app.py) for chats/messages.

Backend fetches them from Telegram/Instagram/Twitter.

AI (BlenderBot) makes smart reply suggestions.

Messages are stored in SQLite database for later.

🔹 What You Need to Install

Run these in terminal:

pip install flask
pip install telethon
pip install transformers
pip install torch
pip install instagrapi
pip install requests

🔹 Setup Needed

Telegram → Get API ID + Hash from [my.telegram.org], put in config.py.

Instagram → Add your username + password in app.py.

Database → Creates messages.db automatically.

Logo → Add logo.png for branding.

🔹 What’s Special About the AI?

Uses BlenderBot (AI chatbot).

Suggests replies automatically when a new message comes.

Suggestions appear in a fun animated box.

🔹 Troubleshooting

Install missing packages if errors show.

Check your API keys & passwords.

If “database locked” → close Python & delete session file.

If Instagram fails → check login / 2FA.

If Telegram asks code → enter it in terminal.

✅ Final Summary

Unified Inbox = One super messenger 📨

Combines Telegram, Instagram, Twitter chats.

Lets you reply from one dashboard.

AI suggests replies to save time.

Stores chats in a local database.

Modern design with animations.

👉 With a few setup steps, you’ll have all your messages in one place — just like magic! ✨
